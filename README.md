This is a [Collective Knowledge](https://github.com/ctuning/ck) repository 
with methodology, templates and workflows to reproduce results 
from published articles (artifact evaluation). See [Artifact Evaluation evaluation website](http://cTuning.org/ae) 
for more details.

Description
===========

Install the Collective Knowledge framework (CK) on Linux, Windows or MacOS 
as described [here](https://ck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/installation.html).

Pull this repository:

```bash
ck pull repo:ck-artifact-evaluation
```

Note that the dependencies on ck-web and other CK repositories 
will be automatically resolved by the CK framework!


```
 $ ck start web
 $ Open web page: http://localhost:3344/?template=artifact-evaluation&page=index
```

That's all!

Note, that it is also possible to create a static website for http://cTuning.org/ae as follows:


```
 $ cd `script/compile-website-adapt-workshop`
 $ ./create_website.sh
```

or on Windows:
```
 $ ck find script/compile-website-adapt-workshop
 $ cd /D {above directory}
 $ create_website.bat
```

CK will create all static html pages in the "tmp-website" sub-directory
that you can upload to your web server.

You can generate a list of artifacts with their ACM badges from the HotCRP JSON file as follows:
```
 $ ck process_hotcrp ae --json_file={downloaded JSON file with decisions from HotCRP}
```

You can also validate your artifact XML before adding it to the ACM DL as follows:
```
```

Artifacts in the CK format
==========================

We promote collaborative and reproducible research where artifacts and workflows are shared along 
with papers in a common format to let the community quickly reuse them and thus
accelerate open science!

You can find all papers with artifacts shared in the CK format [here](https://cknowledge.io/?q=%22reproduced-papers%22%20AND%20%22portable-workflow-ck%22).

Please check the [ACM proceedings](https://doi.org/10.1145/3229762) 
of our [1st ACM ReQUEST tournament](https://portalparts.acm.org/3230000/3229762/fm/frontmatter.pdf) 
with a [live scoreboard](https://cknowledge.io/c/result/pareto-efficient-ai-co-design-tournament-request-acm-asplos-2018/) 
and all artifacts and workflows shared in a [common CK format](https://github.com/ctuning/ck-request-asplos18-results).

You can also check this reusable and customizable artifact from [CGO'17](http://cgo.org/cgo2017) 
with automatic cross-platform software installation and web-based experimental dashboard powered 
by the CK framework:
