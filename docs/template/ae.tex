\section{Artifact Appendix}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Abstract}

{\em Obligatory. Summarize your artifacts (including algorithms, models, data sets, software and hardware) 
and how they help to reproduce the key results from your paper.}

\subsection{Artifact check-list (meta-information)}

{\em Obligatory. Use just a few informal keywords in all fields applicable to your artifacts
and remove the rest. This information is needed to find appropriate reviewers and gradually 
unify artifact meta information in Digital Libraries.}
