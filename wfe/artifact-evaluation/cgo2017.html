<i>
This year we saw a considerable increase in the amount of submitted
artifacts: 27 versus 18 two years ago. The Artifact Evaluation Committee
assembled of 41 researcher and engineer spent two weeks validating
artifacts.  Each artifact received at least three reviews and only 8
artifacts fell significantly below acceptance criteria. 
<p>
Since our philosophy is that AE should act as a mechanism to help authors
prepare their materials and replicate or reproduce experimental results, we
spent one more week shepherding these artifacts. During this process we
allowed back-and-forth anonymous communication between evaluators and
authors to resolve concerns, documentation issues and bugs. At the same
time, we also successfully tried an "open reviewing model", when we asked
the community to publicly evaluate several artifacts already available at
GitHub, GitLab and other project hosting services. This allowed us to find
external reviewers who had access to very rare HPC servers or proprietary
benchmarks and tools. With the help of such shepherding, a 100% success rate
for all 27 artifacts was achieved, which reflects a significant achievement
and effort by both authors and evaluators. We thank them all for their hard
work!
<p>
All papers with evaluated artifacts received an AE seal and were
allowed to add up to 2 pages of Artifact Appendix to let readers 
better understand what was evaluated and how.
</i>

<hr>

<p>
Authors of accepted <a href="http://cgo.org/cgo2017">CGO 2017</a> papers 
will be invited to formally submit their supporting materials to the 
<a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$index$#ck_page_suffix#$">Artifact
Evaluation process</a>. The Artifact Evaluation process
is run by a <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$committee$#ck_page_suffix#$">separate committee</a> 
whose task is to reproduce (at least some) experiments 
and <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$reviewing$#ck_page_suffix#$">assess</a> 
how the artifacts support the work described in the
papers. This submission is voluntary and will not
influence the final decision regarding the papers.

<p>
Papers that successfully go through the Artifact Evaluation 
process will receive a seal of approval printed
on the papers themselves. Authors of such papers will have an option
to include their Artifact Appendix to the final paper (up to 2 pages).
Authors are also encouraged (though not obliged) to make these
materials publicly available upon publication of the
proceedings, by including them as "source materials"
in the Digital Library.

<p>
<i>If you have any questions, please check <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$faq$#ck_page_suffix#$">AE FAQs</a>
and do not hesitate to contact AE chair and the steering committee or post your question
to our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/grp/home?gid=7433414">LinkedIn group</a>.
</i>

<h3>How to submit</h3>

Please prepare your artifacts for submission using the following <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$submission$#ck_page_suffix#$">guide</a>.
Then, register your submission at the joint PPoPP/CGO <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aecgoppopp2017">EasyChair website</a>
- you will be asked to submit your paper title, author list, artifact abstract, pdf of your paper with an appendix describing how to access 
and validate your artifacts, and possible conflicts of interests with  
<a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$committee$#ck_page_suffix#$">AE members</a>. 

<p>
<i>
To encourage reproducible experimentation and participation in artifact evaluation,
<a href="http://research.nvidia.com">NVIDIA</a> will give a high-end GPGPU card for the highest ranked artifact! 
To promote sharing of artifacts and experimental workflows as reusable and customizable components 
<a href="http://cTuning.org">cTuning foundation</a> and <a href="http://dividiti.com">dividiti</a>
will give $500 for the highest ranked experimental workflow implemented using 
<a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Portable-workflows">Collective Knowledge framework</a>.
</i>

<h3>Reviewing process</h3>

Your artifacts will be reviewed according to the following <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$reviewing$#ck_page_suffix#$">guidelines</a>.
Artifacts receiving "met expectations" or above score will pass evaluation and will receive
a stamp of approval. The highest ranked artifacts will receive prizes.

<h3>Feedback</h3>

We consider Artifact Evaluation as a continuous learning curve - 
our eventual goal is to develop a common methodology for experiment sharing
and evaluation in computer system's research. 

Therefore, based on encountered issues during past AE and your feedback,
we are currently developing the following open-source supporting technology for Artifact Evaluation:
<ul>
 <li><a href="https://occam.cs.pitt.edu">OCCAM infrastructure</a> to enable open curation for computer architecture modeling.
 <li>Open-source <a href="http://github.com/ctuning/ck">Collective Knowledge framework</a> 
     to simplify sharing and reuse of experimental workflows 
     and all related artifacts with the possibility to customize, crowdsource, analyze
     and compare empirical experiments (see an example of a <a href="http://cknowledge.org/repo">public repository with the results from collaborative program optimization</a>);
</ul>

<p>
<i>
If you have questions, comments and suggestions on how
to improve artifact submission, reviewing, customization
and reuse, please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:Grigori.Fursin@cTuning.org;childers@cs.pitt.edu">get in touch with the AE steering committee</a>!
