<h4>Artifact submission</h4>

<div style="margin-left:20px;">

<p>
 Artifact evaluation promotes reproducibility of experimental results and
 encourages code and data sharing. 

<p>
 The authors will need to fill in this <a href="https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/artifact-evaluation/template/ae.tex">Artifact Appendix</a>
 to describe the minimal software, hardware and data set requirements, and explaining how to prepare, run and reproduce key experiments.

 The Artifact Appendix should be appended to the accepted paper and submitted for evaluation via <a href="https://micro23-ae.hotcrp.com">MICRO'23 AE HotCRP website</a>.


<p> 
 We introduced this Artifact Appendix to <a href="https://learning.acm.org/techtalks/reproducibility">unify the description of experimental setups
 and results across different conferences</a>.
 Though it is relatively intuitive and based on the feedback from the community, we encourage the authors to check
 the <a href="https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/artifact-evaluation/checklist.md">Artifact Appendix guide</a>,
 <a href="https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/artifact-evaluation/reviewing.md">artifact reviewing guide</a>,
 the <a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/EmpiricalEvaluation">SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Guidelines</a>,
 the <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf">NeurIPS reproducibility checklist</a>,
 <a href="https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/artifact-evaluation/faq.md">AE FAQs</a> 
 and <a href="https://cknow.io/reproduced-papers">Artifact Appendices from past papers</a> before submitting artifacts for evaluation.

<p>
 This submission is <b>voluntary and will not influence</b> the final
 decision regarding the papers - our goal is to help the authors validate
 their experiments by an independent AE Committee in a collaborative and constructive way.
 Furthermore, the authors can add notes and corrections to the Artifact Appendix
 if some mistakes were found during artifact evaluation.

<p>
 The authors are welcome to join the <a href="https://discord.gg/JjWNWXKxwT">public Discord server for automation and reproducibility</a> 
 to get in touch with Artifact Evaluation chairs and get help with the preparation and submission of their artifacts (#general and #artifact-evaluation channels).
 The authors will communicate with evaluators via HotCRP after the submission.

<p>
We suggest the authors to make their artifacts available for evaluation via GitHub or similar public or private service.
Public artifact sharing allows the authors to quickly fix encountered issues during evaluation
before submitting the final version to archival repositories.
Other acceptable methods include:

 <ul>
  <li>
   Using zip or tar files with all related code and data, particularly when code
   must be rebuilt on reviewers' machines (for example to have a non-virtualized access to some specific hardware).
  </li>
  <li>
   Using <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a>, <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org">Virtual Box</a> and other containers and VM images.
  </li>
  <li>
   Arranging remote access to the authors' machine with the pre-installed software
   - this is an exceptional cases when rare or proprietary software and hardware is used.
   The authors will need to privately send the access information to the AE chairs.
  </li>
 </ul>


<p> 
 The papers that successfully go through AE will receive a set of
 <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current">ACM badges</a>
 of approval printed on the papers themselves and available as meta information
 in the ACM Digital Library (it is now possible to search for papers with
 specific badges in the ACM DL). Authors of such papers will have an option to
 include up to 2 pages of their Artifact Appendix to the camera-ready paper.

<p>
To help digest the criteria for the ACM "Artifacts Evaluated – Reusable" badge, we have partnered with <a href="https://mlcommons.org">MLCommons</a> 
to add their <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8105339">unified automation interface (MLCommons CM)</a> 
to the shared artifacts. We opine that MLCommons CM captures the core tenets of ACM "Artifacts Evaluated – Reusable" badge. 
Hence, we have added it as a possible criteria to obtain the ACM "Artifacts Evaluated – Reusable" badge. 
The authors will get free help from MLCommons and the community via the <a href="https://discord.gg/JjWNWXKxwT">public Discord server</a>
or can try to add the MLCommons CM interface to their artifacts themselves using this
<a href="https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/tutorials/common-interface-to-reproduce-research-projects.md">tutorial</a>.

<h4>Artifact evaluation process</h4>

<div style="margin-left:20px;">

<i>Note that our artifact evaluation is single-blind because the paper is accepted, there no need to hide the authors, and we help the authors fix issues, improve their artifacts and pass evaluation.</i>

<p>
  Evaluators will read a paper and then go through the Artifact Appendix to evaluate artifacts and reproduce experiments
  based on <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current">general ACM guidelines</a> 
  and our <a href="https://cTuning.org/ae/reviewing-micro23.html">MICRO'23 guidelines</a>.

<p>
  Reviewers will communicate with the authors about any encountered issue immediately (and anonymously) 
  via the <a href="https://micro23-ae.hotcrp.com">HotCRP submission website</a> 
  to give the authors time to resolve all problems! Note that our philosophy 
  is not to fail problematic artifacts but to help the authors improve 
  their public artifacts and pass the evaluation!

<p>
  In the end, AE chairs will communicate with the authors and decide on a set of the standard ACM reproducibility
  badges to award to a given paper/artifact based on all reviews and the authors' responses.
