This document (<b>V20201122</b>) provides the guidelines to evaluate artifacts across a range of systems and machine learning conferences and journals.

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Reviewing process</h2>

<div style="margin-left:20px;">

  <p>
  Shortly after the artifact submission deadline, the AE committee members 
  will bid on artifacts they would like to review based on their competencies 
  and the information provided in the artifact abstract such as software and hardware dependencies
  while avoiding possible conflicts of interest.

  Within a few days, AE chairs will make the final selection of reviewers
  to ensure at least two or more reviewers per artifact.

  <p>
  Reviewers will then have approximately 2..3 weeks to evaluate artifacts 
  and provide a report using a dedicated artifact submission website 
  (usually <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/acm-ppopp19-artifact-evaluation-report-hotcrp-grigori-fursin/">HotCRP</a>).

  Reviewers are strongly encouraged to communicate with the authors about encountered issues 
  immediatelly (and anonymously) via the HotCRP submission website to give the authors time to 
  resolve all problems! Note that our philosophy of artifact evaluation is not to fail problematic artifacts 
  but to help the authors improve their artifacts (at least publicly available ones) and pass the evaluation!

  <p>
  In the end, AE chairs will decide on a set of the standard ACM reproducibility badges (see below)
  to award to a given artifact based on all reviews as well as the authors' responses.
  Such badges can be printed on the 1st page of the paper and can be made available as meta information in some Digital Libraries 
  such as the <a href="https://dl.acm.org">ACM DL</a>.

  <p>
  Authors and reviewers are encouraged to check the <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$faq$#ck_page_suffix#$">AE FAQ</a>
  and the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/artifact-evaluation">dedicated AE google group</a> in case of questions or suggestions.

</div>

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>Artifact evaluation</h2>

<div style="margin-left:20px;">

<p>
  Reviewers will need to read a paper and then thoroughly go through the Artifact Appendix 
  step-by-step to evaluate a given artifact. They should then describe their experience at each stage 
  (success or failure, encountered problems and how they were possibly solved, 
  and questions or suggestions to the authors), and then give a score 
  on scale -1 .. +1 where

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>+1)</b> exceeded expectations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>0)</b> met expectations (or inapplicable)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-1)</b> fell below expectations<br>

      Are all artifacts related to this paper publicly available?
      <p><i>Note that it is not obligatory to make artifacts publicly available!</i>
     </td>
     <td>
The author-created artifacts relevant to this paper 
will receive an ACM "artifact available" badge 
<b>only if</b> they have been placed on
a publicly accessible archival repository
such as <a href="https://zenodo.org">Zenodo</a>, 
<a href="https://figshare.com">FigShare</a>,
and <a href="http://datadryad.org">Dryad</a>.
A DOI will be then assigned to their artifacts
and must be provided in the Artifact Appendix!

<p>
<b>Notes:</b>

<ul>

 <li>
  ACM does not mandate the use of above repositories. However, publisher repositories,
  institutional repositories, or open commercial repositories are acceptable
  <b>only</b> if they have a declared plan to enable permanent accessibility!
  <b>Personal web pages, GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket are not acceptable for this purpose.</b>
 </li>

 <li>
  Artifacts do not need to have been formally evaluated in order for an article
  to receive this badge. In addition, they need not be complete in the sense
  described above. They simply need to be relevant to the study and add value
  beyond the text in the article. Such artifacts could be something as simple
  as the data from which the figures are drawn, or as complex as a complete
  software system under study.
 </li>

 <li>
  The authors can provide the DOI at the very end of the AE process 
  and use GitHub or any other convenient way to access their artifacts 
  during AE.

The artifacts associated with the paper will receive an "Artifacts Evaluated

validation.

We usually ask the authors to provide a small/sample data set to validate at least
some results from the paper to make sure that their artifact is functional.

The artifacts associated with the paper will receive an "Artifact Evaluated - Reusable" badge 
<i>only if</i> they are of a quality that significantly exceeds minimal functionality. 
That is, they have all the qualities of the Artifacts Evaluated - Functional level, 
but, in addition, they are very carefully documented and well-structured to the extent 
that reuse and repurposing is facilitated. 

<p>
We usually ask the authors to demonstrate how their artifact can work on a different platform,
in a different environment, with a different model/data set/software. We want to make sure
that it is possible to reuse a given artifact in a different experimental setup.

     </td>

The artifacts associated with the paper will receive a
"Results reproduced" badge <i>only if</i> the main results

by a person or team other than the authors, using, 
in part, artifacts provided by the author.

       Note that the variation of empirical and numerical results is tolerated.
       In fact it is often unavoidable in computer systems research - see
       "how to report and compare empirical results" in the
       <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$faq$#ck_page_suffix#$">AE FAQ</a> page,
       the <a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/EmpiricalEvaluation">SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Guidelines</a>,

       <p>
       <i>Since it may take weeks and even months to rerun some complex experiments 
       such as deep learning model training, we are discussing a staged AE where we will first validate that
       artifacts are functional before the camera ready paper deadline, and then
       use a separate AE with the full validation of all experimental results 
       with open reviewing and without strict deadlines. We successfully validated
       a similar approach at the <a href="https://cKnowledge.org/request">ACM ASPLOS-ReQuEST'18 tournament (SW/HW co-design of Pareto-efficient deep learning)</a>
       and <a href="https://adapt-workshop.org">ADAPT'16</a>,
