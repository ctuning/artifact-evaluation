This guide (<b>V20151015</b>) should help you describe 
and submit your artifacts for a review.


It gradually evolves based on <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$prior_ae$#ck_page_suffix#$">our past Artifact Evaluations</a>
and your feedback (see this <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/GrigoriFursin/presentation-fursin-aecgoppopp2015">presentation</a>
with an outcome of the past PPoPP/CGO'15 AE).


It should also help you prepare your artifacts 
for a possible public release, if you plan to do so
(for example as an auxiliary material in a Digital
Library or on your personal web page).

<h1><a name="expect"><u>What to expect</u></a></h1>

<p>
We are trying to make artifact submission as simple as possible.
You just need to pack your artifact (code and data) using any publicly avialable tool 
you prefer or arrange a remote access to machine with pre-installed software 
(exceptional cases when rare hardware or proprietary software is used). 
<p>
Then, you need to prepare a small and informal guide for reviewers 
using our AE LaTeX template (see below) to explain what are your artifacts, how to access and 
use them, and what is the expected result (<i>we currently discuss with the 
conference chairs and ACM to let you keep it as Appendix in your 
paper if your artifact passes evaluation</i>).

<p>
At least two reviewers will follow your guide to <i>replicate</i> your results (for example, exact output match) 
or <i>reproduce</i> them (for example, varying performance numbers or scalability
on a different machine), and will then send you a report with the 
following overall assessment of your artifact based 
on our <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$reviewing$#ck_page_suffix#$">reviewing guidelines</a>:

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>significantly exceeded expectations</b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>exceeded expectations</b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>met expectations </b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>fell below expectations</b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>significantly fell below expectations</b>
 </li>
</ul>

where <b>"met expectations" score or above</b> means that your artifact 
successfully passed evaluation and will receive a stamp of approval
(added to the paper itself):

<center>
<img src="$#ck_url_template_pull#$resources/ae_logo.png">
</center>

The highest ranked artifact (usually not only
reproducible but also customizable and reusable) will
also receive a <i>"distinguished artifact" award</i>
announced at the joint CGO-PPoPP'16 AE discussion session.

This section is also used as a discussion forum with the community
about how to improve AE.

<p>
Since our eventual goal is to promote artifact
validation and sharing (rather than naming and shaming
problematic artifacts), you will be able to address
raised issues during the rebuttal.

Furthermore, we allow a small amount of communication 
between reviewers and authors whenever there are 
installation/usage problems.

In such cases, AE chairs will serve as a proxy to avoid 
revealing reviewers' identity (the review is blind,
i.e. your identity is known to reviewers since your paper 
is already accepted, but not vice versa).

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>
<h1><a name="prepare"><u>Preparing artifacts for submission</u></a></h1>

You just need to perform the following 4 steps to submit your artifact:

<ol>
 <li>
  <b>Pack your artifact</b> (code and data) or provide an easy access to them 
  using any publicly available and free tool you prefer or strictly require. 
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, you can use the following:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org">Virtual Box</a> to pack all code and data including OS 
    (typical images are around 2..3GB. we strongly recommend to avoid images larger than 10GB).
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a> to pack only touched code and data during experiment. 
   </li>
   <li>
    Standard zip or tar with all related code and data, particularly when artifact
    should be rebuilt on a reviewers machine (for example to have a non-virtualized access to a specific hardware). 
   </li>
   <li>
    Private or public GIT or SVN.
   </li>
   <li>
    Arrange a remote access to machine with pre-installed software 
    (<i>exceptional cases when rare hardware or proprietary software is used or the VM image is too large)</i>) 
    - you will need to privately send the access information to the AE chairs. Also, please avoid making any changes
    to the remote machine during evaluation (unless explicitly agreed with AE chairs) - you can do it during
    rebuttal phase, if needed!
   </li>
  </ul>
  You can also check and use <a href="http://ctuning.org/cm/wiki/index.php?title=Reproducibility#Resources">other public tools</a> 
  available for artifact sharing.

  <br><br>
   Note that after experiencing various sharing and
   reproducibility issues during <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/GrigoriFursin/presentation-fursin-aecgoppopp2015">past Artifact Evaluation</a>,
   we started developing new and open-source technology
   which involves the community to solve them. If you 
   are interested to check it out, we will be happy 
   to help you use this technology or get your feedback 
   to improve it for the future AE:

  <ul>
   <li>
    <b><a href="https://occam.cs.pitt.edu">OCCAM Framework</a></b> to enable open curation for computer architecture modeling.
   </li>
   <li>
    <b><a href="http://github.com/ctuning/ck">Collective Knowledge Framework (CK)</a></b> to decompose 
    ad-hoc experimental workflows, scripts and VM/Docker images into reusable and customizable components
    while using already installed and possibly proprietary tools, benchmarks and data sets 
    (see example of <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Getting_started_guide_clsmith">PLDI'15 CLSmith artifact</a> 
    converted to <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck-clsmith">CK format</a>

     shared via <a href="http://github.com/ctuning/reproduce-ck-paper">GitHub<a>). 
     at <a href="http://cgo.org/cgo2016">CGO'16</a></i>.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>

 <br>
 <li>
  <b>Write a brief artifact abstract</b> to informally describe your artifact including minimal
  hardware and software requirements, how it supports your paper, how it can be validated and
  what is the expected result. It will be used to select appropriate reviewers.
 </li>
 
 <br>
 <li>
  <b>Fill in and append AE template (<a href="$#ck_url_template_pull#$templates/ae-20151015.tex">download here</a>)</b> to the PDF of your accepted paper.
  Though it should be relatively intuitive, you can check out <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$submission_extra$#ck_page_suffix#$">extra notes about this template</a> based on our past AE experience.
 </li>

 <br>
 <li>
  <b>Submit artifact abstract and new PDF </b> at 
  <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aecgoppopp2016">this EasyChair website</a> for the joint PPoPP/CGO 2016 AE.

<p>
<h1><a name="accepted"><u>If accepted</u></a></h1>

 You can now add the following stamp to the final camera-ready version of your paper:

 <ul>
  <li>for CGO: <a href="$#ck_url_template_pull#$stamps/ae-cgo.pdf">PDF</a>
  <li>for PPoPP: <a href="$#ck_url_template_pull#$stamps/ae-ppopp.pdf">PDF</a>
 </ul>

 While there are no strict formatting rules for the stamp,
 please add it anywhere close to the title. For example,
 see <a href="http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~mad/publications/ppopp2015-prcu.pdf">PPoPP'15 article</a> 
 together with this <a href="$#ck_url_template_pull#$stamps/logo-latex.tex">LaTeX example</a>.
 You can change \hspace and \raisebox parameters to better fit stamp to your paper.

 <p>
 We strongly encourage you to submit your AE appendix 
 as an auxiliary material for Digital Library 
 (while removing all unnecessary or confidential information) 
 along with the final variant of your paper. This will help
 readers better understand what was evaluated.
 We currently discuss procedures with ACM DL colleagues -
 please stay tuned!

 <p>
 Though you are not obliged to publicly release your artifacts 
 (in fact, it is sometimes impossible due to various limitations), 
 we also strongly encourage you to share them with the community
 (even if they are not open-source).

 You can release them as an auxiliary material in Digital Libraries
 together with your AE appendix or use your institutional repository
 and various public services for code and data sharing.

 <p>
 <i>Even accepted artifacts may have some unforeseen behavior and limitations
 discovered during evaluation. Now you have a chance to add related notes 
 to your paper as a future work (if you wish).</i>.

 <p>
 Note, that we are developing open-source <a href="http://github.com/ctuning/ck">Collective Knowledge framework</a> 
 to help researchers share their artifacts as unified, reusable and customizable components together
 with experimental workflows and interactive articles. If you are interested to know
 more, please check some <a href="http://cknowledge.org/repo">online examples</a> 
 and recent <a href="http://bit.ly/ck-date16">DATE'16 paper</a>.
