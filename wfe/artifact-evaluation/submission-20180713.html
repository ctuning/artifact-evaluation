<h1><a name="expect"><u>What to expect</u></a></h1>

<p>
We aim to formalize and unify artifact submission while still keeping it as simple as possible.
You will need to pack your artifacts (code and data) using any publicly available tool. 
In some exceptional cases when rare hardware or proprietary software is used,
you can arrange a remote access to a machine with the pre-installed software.
Then you need to prepare a small and informal Artifact Appendix
using our <a href="$#ck_url_template_pull#$templates/ae-20180713.tex">AE LaTeX template</a> 
(now used by CGO, PPoPP, Supercomputing, PACT, IA3, RTSS, ReQuEST and other ACM/IEEE conferences and workshops) 
to explain evaluators what your artifacts are and how to use them.
You will normally be allowed to add up to 2 pages of this Appendix to your final camera-ready paper.
You will need to add this appendix to you paper and submit it to the AE submission website for a given event.
You can find examples of such AE appendices in the following papers:
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3229762.3229763">ReQuEST-ASPLOS'18</a> 
(associated <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck-request-asplos18-caffe-intel">CK workflow</a>), 
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sa614/papers/Software-Prefetching-CGO2017.pdf">CGO'17</a>, 
<a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.05387v6.pdf">PPoPP'16</a>,
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxJn2NuLIEx_dnRlSHU3MlpHSGs/view">SC'16</a>.

<p>
At least three reviewers will follow your guide to evaluate your artifacts and will then send you a report 
with the following overall assessment of your artifact based 
on our <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$reviewing$#ck_page_suffix#$">reviewing guidelines</a>:

<ul>
 <li>
  <b>exceeded expectations</b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>met expectations </b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>fell below expectations</b>
 </li>
</ul>

where <b>"met expectations" score or above</b> means that your artifact 
successfully passed evaluation and will receive the following stamps of approval 
depending on the event:

<p>
The highest ranked artifact which is not only reproducible 
but also easily customizable and reusable typically 
receives a <i>"distinguished artifact" award</i>.

<p>
Since our eventual goal is to promote <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2618142">collaborative and reproducible research</a>, 
we see AE as a cooperative process between authors 
and reviewers to validate shared artifacts rather than naming and shaming
problematic artifacts. Therefore, we allow communication between authors
and reviewers to fix raised issues until a given artifact can pass evaluation
unless a major problem is encountered.

In such cases, AE chairs will either serve as a proxy to avoid 
revealing reviewers' identity or will allow direct anonymous
communication between authors and reviewers via submission website
or via issues at public repositories such as GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket
(reviews are blind, i.e. your identity is known to reviewers since your paper 
is already accepted, but not vice versa).

<p>
<h1><a name="prepare"><u>Preparing artifacts for submission</u></a></h1>

You need to perform the following steps to submit your artifact for evaluation:

<ol>
 <li>
  <b>Prepare experimental workflow</b>.

  <p><i>Note that if you just want to make your artifacts publicly available
  (which is also encouraged) without validation of experimental results, please go to the next step</i>.

  <p>You need to provide at least some scripts or <a href="http://jupyter.org">Jupyter Notebooks</a>
  to prepare and run experiments, as well as reporting and validating results. 

  <p>
  However, we have noticed during <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/GrigoriFursin/enabling-open-and-reproducible-computer-systems-research-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">past Artifact Evaluation</a>
  that the biggest burden for evaluators is to deal with numerous ad-hoc scripts to prepare, customize and run experiments,
  try other benchmarks, data sets, compilers and simulators, analyze results and compare them with the ones from the paper. 

  <p>
  That is why we collaborative with <a href="http://acm.org">ACM</a> to encourage the use of workflow frameworks with portable package managers
  and unified APIs such as <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Adding-new-workflows">Collective Knowledge (CK)</a> instead of ad-hoc scripts
  to help evaluators automate installation, execution, validation and customization of your experiments.

  <p>
  See how researchers use CK during <a href="http://cKnowledge.org/request">ACM tournaments to co-design efficient SW/HW stack</a>:
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3229762">ACM Digital Library</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck-request-asplos18-results">GitHub with reusable CK workflows</a>,
  <a href="https://portalparts.acm.org/3230000/3229762/fm/frontmatter.pdf">ReQuEST report</a>. 

  <p>
  Also note that the <a href="http://cTuning.org">cTuning foundation</a>
  and <a href="http://dividiti.com">dividiti</a> offer 
  <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Contacts">free community help</a>
  to convert your artifacts to the CK format while reusing 
  a <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Shared-repos#user-content-shared-workflows">growing number of unified CK components</a>
  (programs, workflows, packages, software detection plugins, etc).

  Check out the following papers with artifacts and workflows in the CK format:  
  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3229762.3229763">ReQuEST-ASPLOS'18</a> 
  (associated <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck-request-asplos18-caffe-intel">CK workflow</a>), 
  <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sa614/papers/Software-Prefetching-CGO2017.pdf">CGO'17</a>, 
  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3149704.3149768">IA3'17</a>,
  <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2807591.2807619">SC'15</a>.

 <li>
  <b>Pack your artifact</b> (code and data) or provide an easy access to them 
  using any publicly available and free tool you prefer or strictly require. 
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, you can use the following:
  <ul>
   <li>
    <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org">Virtual Box</a> to pack all code and data including OS 
    (typical images are around 2..3GB; we strongly recommend to avoid images larger than 10GB).
   </li>
   <li>
    <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a> to pack only touched code and data during experiment. 
   </li>
   <li>
    Standard zip or tar with all related code and data, particularly when an artifact
    should be rebuilt on a reviewers machine (for example to have a non-virtualized access to a specific hardware). 
    You may check <a href="https://www.reprozip.org">ReproZip</a> tool to automatically pack your artifacts with all dependencies.
   </li>
   <li>
    Private or public GIT or SVN.
   </li>
   <li>
    Arrange a remote access to a machine with pre-installed software 
    (<i>exceptional cases when rare hardware or proprietary software is used or your VM image is too large</i>) 
    - you will need to privately send the access information to the AE chairs. Also, please avoid making any changes
    to the remote machine during evaluation unless explicitly agreed with AE chairs - you can do it during
    the rebuttal phase if needed!
   </li>
   <li>
    Check <a href="http://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Enabling-open-science-tools">other tools</a> 
    which can be useful for artifact and workflow sharing.
  </ul>

  <br>

 <li>
  <b>Write a brief artifact abstract with a SW/HW check-list</b> to informally describe your artifact 
  including minimal hardware and software requirements, how it supports your paper, how it can be validated and
  what the expected result is. Particularly stress if you use any proprietary software or hardware
  <b>Note that it is critical to help AE chairs select appropriate reviewers</b>!
  If you use proprietary benchmarks or tools (SPEC, Intel compilers, etc), 
  we suggest you to provide a simplified test case with open source software 
  to be able to quickly validate functionality of your experimental workflow.
 </li>
 
 <br>
 <li>
  <b>Fill in and append AE template (<a href="$#ck_url_template_pull#$templates/ae-20180713.tex">download here</a>)</b> to the PDF of your (accepted) paper.
  Though it should be relatively intuitive, we still strongly suggest you to
  check out <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$submission_extra$#ck_page_suffix#$">extra notes
  about how to fill in this template</a> based on our past AE experience.
 </li>

 <br>
 <li>
  <b>Submit artifact abstract and the new PDF </b> at the AE submission website depending on a conference, tournament, workshop or journal.
 </li>

</ol>

<i>
If you encounter problems, find some ambiguities or have any questions, 
do not hesitate to get in touch with the AE community via 
the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/artifact-evaluation">dedicated AE google group</a>.
</i>

<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<p>
<h1><a name="accepted"><u>If accepted</u></a></h1>

 We strongly encourage you to add up to 2 pages of your AE appendix 
 to your camera ready paper while removing all unnecessary or confidential information. 
 This will help readers better understand what was evaluated.
 If your paper will be published in the ACM Digital Library,
 you do not need to add reproducibility stamps yourself - ACM will add them to your camera-ready paper!
 In other cases, AE chairs will tell you how to add a stamp to your paper.

 <p>
 Though you are not obliged to publicly release your artifacts 
 (in fact, it is sometimes impossible due to various limitations), 
 we also strongly encourage you to share them with the community.

 You can release them as standalone artifacts with a DOI in ACM Digital Library
 (see <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3229770">artifact example</a> from the 1st ACM ReQuEST tournament),
 via other permanent repositories or using your institutional repository (if it has a plan for permanent archiving).

 <p>
 <i>Sometimes artifact evaluation help discover some minor mistakes in the accepted paper -
 in such case you now have a chance to add related notes and corrections
 in the Artifact Appendix of your camera-ready paper.</i>.
