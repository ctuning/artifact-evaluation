<h1><a name="extended"><u>Extended artifact description (V20161020)</u></a></h1>

Here we provide a few informal suggestions to help you fill in your AE template for submission.

They are based on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/GrigoriFursin/presentation-fursin-aecgoppopp2015">our 
past Artifact Evaluations</a> to help you avoid common issues and reduce reviewers burden.

 <h2><a name="desc_abstract">Abstract</a></h2>

  Briefly and informally describe your artifact including minimal hardware and software requirements, 
  how it supports your paper, how it can be validated, and what is the expected result. It will be used
  to select appropriate reviewers.

   <h3>Artifact check-list (meta-information)</h3>

     Together with artifact abstract, this informal check-list will help us make sure that reviewers 
     have appropriate competency as well as technology to evaluate your artifact. 
     It can also be used as meta information
     to find your artifacts in Digital Libraries (<i>under discussion/development</i>).
     It was created based on past AE experience and your feedback as such to cover most of the 
     artifacts in computer systems' research including SW/HW co-design, benchmarking, design space exploration, 
     autotuning, architecture simulation, run-time adaptation, and more.

       </li>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
   <h3>How delivered</h3>

     Describe, how reviewers can access your artifact:
     <ul>
      <li>Download package from a public website</li>
      <li>Download package from a private website (you will need to send information how to access your artifact to AE chairs)</li>
      <li>Access artifact via private machine with pre-installed software (only when access to rare hardware is required or proprietary
           software is used - you will need to send information and credentials to access your machine to AE chairs)</li>
     </ul>

     Please, describe approximate disk space required after unpacking your artifact 
     (to avoid surprises when artifact requires 20GB of free space). We do not have
     a strict limit but strongly suggest to limit space to several GB and avoid including 
     unnecessary software to your VM images.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
   <h3>Hardware dependencies</h3>

    Describe any specific hardware and its features
    strictly required to evaluate your artifact 
    (vendor, CPU/GPU/FPGA, number of processors/cores, interconnect, memory, 
    hardware counters, etc).

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
   <h3>Software dependencies</h3>

    Describe any specific OS and software packages required to evaluate your
    artifact. This is particularly important if you share source code 
    that has to be rebuilt or if you rely on proprietary software that you
    can not include to your package. In such case, we strongly suggest to describe 
    where to get and to install all third-party tools.

    <br><br>
    <i>Note that we are trying to obtain AE licenses for some commonly used proprietary tools and benchmarks 
    (you will be informed in case of positive outcome).</i>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
   <h3>Data sets</h3>

    If third-party data sets are not included in your packages (for example, 
    they are very large or proprietary), please provide details how to download
    and install them. 

    <i>In case of proprietary data sets, we suggest you provide reviewers
    a public alternative subset for evaluation</i>.

  </div>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <h2><a name="desc_installation">Installation</a></h2>

 Describe installation and setup procedures for your artifact
 (even if you use VM image or access to remote machine) targeting
 a novice user. 

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <h2><a name="desc_workflow">Experiment workflow</a></h2>

  Describe experiment workflow and how it is implemented, 
  invoked and customized (if needed), i.e. some OS scripts, 
  <a href="http://jupyter.org">IPython/Jupyter notebook</a>, 
  <a href="http://github.com/ctuning/ck">portable CK workflow</a>, etc.

  See the following example of the experimental workflow 
  for multi-objective and machine-learning based autotuning:

  </a>
  </center>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <h2><a name="desc_evaluation">Evaluation and expected result</a></h2>

  Describe all steps necessary to evaluate your artifact
  using the workflow above. Also describe whether reviewers
  will need to replicate (exact result match) or reproduce (possibly
  varying result or different experimental conditions) the output.
  Finally, describe the expected result as well as allowable variation
  (particularly important for performance numbers and speed-ups).

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <h2><a name="desc_evaluation">Experiment customization</a></h2>

  It is currently optional since it is not always trivial.
  If possible, describe how to customize your workflow, i.e. if 
  it is possible to use different data sets, benchmarks, real applications,
  predictive models, software environment (compilers, libraries, 
  run-time systems), hardware, etc. Also, describe if it is possible 
  to parameterize your workflow (whatever is applicable such as 
  changing number of threads, optimizations, CPU/GPU frequency, 
  accuracy, autotuning scenario, etc).

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <h2>Notes</h2>

 You can add informal notes for reviewers to draw
 their attention to known or possible issues (particularly
 if you plan to continue working on them after submission).
