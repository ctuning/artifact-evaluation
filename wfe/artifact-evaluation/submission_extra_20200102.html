  Here we provide a few informal suggestions to help you fill in your <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck-artifact-evaluation/blob/master/wfe/artifact-evaluation/templates/ae.tex">Artifact Appendix</a> 
  for submission while avoiding common pitfalls.  

  After introducing it in 2014, we regularly update it based on 
  our <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$prior_ae$#ck_page_suffix#$">past Artifact Evaluation experience</a> and open reproducibility discussions
   (<a href="https://portalparts.acm.org/3230000/3229762/fm/frontmatter.pdf">2018</a>,
   <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/GrigoriFursin/enabling-open-and-reproducible-computer-systems-research-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">2017a</a>,
   <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/GrigoriFursin/cgoppopp17-artifact-evaluation-discussion-enabling-open-and-reproducible-research">2017b</a>,
   <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/GrigoriFursin/panel-at-acmsigplantrust2014">2014</a>),
  the feedback we receive from researchers (<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/artifact-evaluation">Artifact Evaluation google group</a>, 
   <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QZzRVMZMsMev3lxBgHG4TFHEFXy__N7B69ysWXi0ZcY/edit">Shared Google doc</a>),
  <a href="http://artifact-eval.org">PL AE</a>, 
  and the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging">ACM reviewing and badging policy</a> 
   which we are contributing to as a member of the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/task-force-on-data-software-and-reproducibility">ACM taskforce on reproducibility</a>.
  Our goal is to come up with a common methodology and an <a href="https://codereef.ai/portal">open reproducibility platform</a> for artifact sharing, validation, automation and reuse.

 <h2><a name="desc_abstract">Abstract</a></h2>

  Briefly and informally describe your artifact including minimal hardware and software requirements, 
  how it supports your paper, how it can be validated, and what is the expected result. It will be used
  to select appropriate reviewers.
  It will also help readers understand what was evaluated and how.

 <!------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <h2>Artifact check-list (meta-information)</h2>

     Together with the artifact abstract, this informal check-list will help us make sure that reviewers 
     have appropriate competency and an access to the technology required to evaluate your artifact. 
     It can also be used as meta information to find your artifacts in Digital Libraries.

 <h2><a name="desc_description">Description</a></h2>
  <div style="margin-left: 20px;">

   <h3>How to access</h3>

     Describe, how reviewers can access your artifact:
     <ul>
      <li>Clone repository from GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket or any similar service</li>
      <li>Download package from a public website</li>
      <li>Download package from a private website (you will need to send information how to access your artifact to AE chairs)</li>
      <li>Access artifact via private machine with pre-installed software (only when access to rare hardware is required or proprietary
           software is used - you will need to send information and credentials to access your machine to the AE chairs)</li>
     </ul>

     Please describe approximate disk space required after unpacking your artifact 
     (to avoid surprises when artifact requires 20GB of free space). We do not have
     a strict limit but strongly suggest to limit the space to several GB 
     and avoid including unnecessary software packages to your VM images.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
   <h3>Hardware dependencies</h3>

    Describe any specific hardware and specific features
    required to evaluate your artifact 
    (vendor, CPU/GPU/FPGA, number of processors/cores, interconnect, memory, 
    hardware counters, etc).

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
   <h3>Software dependencies</h3>

    Describe any specific OS and software packages required to evaluate your
    artifact. This is particularly important if you share your source code 
    and it must be compiled or if you rely on some proprietary software that you
    can not include to your package. In such case, we strongly suggest you 
    to describe how to obtain and to install all third-party software, data sets
    and models.

    <br><br>
    <i>Note that we are trying to obtain AE licenses for some commonly used proprietary tools and benchmarks 
    - you will be informed in case of positive outcome.</i>


<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
   <h3>Data sets</h3>

    If third-party data sets are not included in your packages (for example, 
    they are very large or proprietary), please provide details about how to download
    and install them. 

    <i>In case of proprietary data sets, we suggest you provide reviewers
    a public alternative subset for evaluation</i>.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
   <h3>Models</h3>

    If third-party models are not included in your packages (for example, 
    they are very large or proprietary), please provide details about how to download
    and install them. 

  </div>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <h2><a name="desc_installation">Installation</a></h2>

 Describe the setup procedures for your artifact 
 targeting novice users
 (even if you use VM image or access to remote machine) . 

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <h2><a name="desc_workflow">Experiment workflow</a></h2>

  Describe the experimental workflow and how it is implemented, 
  invoked and customized (if needed), i.e. some OS scripts, 
  <a href="http://jupyter.org">IPython/Jupyter notebook</a>, 
  <a href="https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Adding-new-workflows">portable CK workflow</a>, etc.

  <p>
  See examples of <a href="https://codereef.ai/portal/search/?q=%22reproduced-papers%22%20AND%20%22portable-workflow-ck%22">reproduced papers</a>
  with portable workflows and an example of the experimental workflow 
  for multi-objective and machine-learning based autotuning:

  </a>
  </center>

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <h2><a name="desc_evaluation">Evaluation and expected result</a></h2>

  Describe all the steps necessary to evaluate your artifact
  using the workflow above. Describe the expected result and the maximum allowable variation
  of empirical results (particularly important for performance numbers and speed-ups).
  See the <a href="https://www.sigarch.org/a-checklist-manifesto-for-empirical-evaluation-a-preemptive-strike-against-a-replication-crisis-in-computer-science/">SIGARCH empirical checklist</a>,
  the <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf">NeurIPS reproducibility checklist</a>
  and the <a href="$#ck_root_page_url#$faq$#ck_page_suffix#$">AE FAQ</a>.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <h2><a name="desc_evaluation">Experiment customization</a></h2>

  It is currently optional since it is not always trivial.
  If possible, describe how to customize your workflow, i.e. if 
  it is possible to use different data sets, benchmarks, real applications,
  predictive models, software environment (compilers, libraries, 
  run-time systems), hardware, etc. Also, describe if it is possible 
  to parameterize your workflow (whatever is applicable such as 
  changing number of threads, applying different optimizations, CPU/GPU frequency, 
  autotuning scenario, model topology, etc). 

  See artifact description of the <a href="https://codereef.ai/portal/search/?q=%22reproduced-papers%22%20AND%20%22portable-workflow-ck%22">reproduced systems and ML papers</a> 
  with portable, customizable and reusable workflows.

<!------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <h2>Notes</h2>

 You can add informal notes to draw the attention of reviewers
 about specific requirements to evaluate your artifact.
